# Sign Language Learning and Translation (SLLT) Application:

1- Introduction: -

This project involves analyzing and designing a prototyping application that automates the sign language learning operation of Palestine Authority Distributor user especially 
the user with disability that loss hearing (Deaf). The main objective of this project is to process of communication between users especially deaf to be more effectively and
efficiently through a Sign Language Learning and translation (SLLT) application. application will make user be able to communicate user with each other with multiple way, 
which can be either translate text or sound record into sign language signal, or by translate image or live video of sign language signal into character/s or combine them into
world/s, the application will make communication between users to be easier and faster.
is Mobile application specialized in sign language like most of mobile application that represent an increasingly important part of Social Engagement and interaction. When the
people needs to communicate with other people, specially people with disability that doesn't hear such as Deaf and need to communicate with other people by using sign language.
This application will make communication easier, and efficient between people especially deaf.

2- System Problem: -

"deaf" are people can't hear other voice and need a way to communicate with other people to able to understand others and contract with him.
How can you learn and how to use sign language to communicate with other individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing at home?
Using our application provide chance to use mobile application it allows the use to learn and translate sign language accurately by know each character and it correspond sign language signal. It provides services associated with engagement and interaction and ease communication with deaf. It solves problem that face people in communication process especially with deaf. Allow the user to install application on their smartphone and ability to use the service directly.
There are 15,000 deaf people in Gaza out of a population of 1.8 million, according to the census in 2014, and poverty continues, and contribute back to underserved populations in the Palestine as Gaza that struggle every day to sustain a family that have person/s with disability like deaf, and who do not have as much scope or communication channel for interaction as other regular groups. The Software System project I want to accomplish throughout my career.

3- System Goal: -

1. To educate and understand a sign language easier, faster and more efficiently.
2. Ease of follow-up sign language by learn and translate it.
3. The user can access application from any mobile with Android OS
4. Help user to save his/her time and effort.
5. The possibility of gain knowledge about lot of character and world available on application dictionary.
6. Allow user to able to be communication with deaf with more flexibility and simplicity.

4- Technologies and Tools: -

  4.1 OpenCV:
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library. OpenCV was built to provide a common infrastructure for computer vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in the commercial products. Being a BSD-licensed product, OpenCV makes it easy for businesses to utilize and modify the code. It has C++, Python, Java and MATLAB interfaces and supports Windows, Linux, Android and Mac OS. OpenCV leans mostly towards real-time vision applications and takes advantage of MMX and SSE instructions when available.
The library has more than 2500 optimized algorithms, which includes a comprehensive set of both classic and state-of-the-art computer vision and machine learning algorithms, OpenCV is written natively in C++ and has a templated interface that works seamlessly with STL containers, for that we need to use Native developer kit (NDK) for deal and use C++ code in android application to get results.

  4.2 TensorFlow:
TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and deploy ML powered applications.
Itâ€™s make easy model building Build and train ML models easily using intuitive high-level APIs like Keras. Robust ML production anywhere Easily train and deploy models in the cloud such as teachable machine, Microsoft azar, and other sites provide this service in the cloud, beside that TensorFlow give Powerful experimentation for research that simple and flexible architecture to take new ideas from concept to code, to state-of-the-art models.
For our application we used TensorFlow edition that work with mobile platform (IOS, Android) that consist of Inference is performed using the TensorFlow Lite Java API, which consider in general contain two part, the first part is model that created after apply machine learning algorithms to predict result using labels which represent second part of TensorFlow.

  4.3 TensorFlow: 
Firebase is a mobile and web application development platform, backed by Google, for developers to create richer app experiences. Firebase manages its own infrastructure with a nice set of tools to simplify the workflow of the developer by providing them with development kits and an online dashboard. These toolkits are interconnected, scalable and integrable with third party software to overcome complex challenges with standard building blocks.
The platform consists of a great set of development tools. The Realtime Database and Cloud Firestore can stock document-structured data and synchronize the corresponding apps in milliseconds whenever a data transformation occurs. This means that both the app and its database listen to each other, providing the user with reactive app experiences. And Firebase Cloud Functions can even extend this functionality. These functions allow the developer to write backend code to respond to events happening in the Firebase platform without having to deal with any servers.

6- Future Work: -

In future, we will offer this application to deploy on an international store apple and android store.
We going to add many other features to the application system such as:
1- expends the database to include word and multi-language.
2- improve the user interface to include pen draw.
3- improve degree of prediction accuracy by improve model with more advanced technology
4- improve algorithmic to more effective and efficient to increase accurate predicted result.
5- use one or two hand together to predict common.
